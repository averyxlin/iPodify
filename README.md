# iPodify

A modern music database and API built with Django and React, featuring an iPod-inspired interface with Spotify integration.

## Project Requirements Compliance

This project meets the full-stack coding task requirements with the following implementation:

### Item Management System
- **Items** = Songs (with title, artist, album, year, duration, etc.)
- **Groups** = Artist (Primary group) and Album (Secondary group)
- **Unique Constraints**: No duplicate song titles within the same artist (Primary group) AND no duplicate song titles within the same album (Secondary group)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/songs/` - List all items (songs) with pagination and filtering
- `POST /api/songs/` - Create new item (song)
- `PUT /api/songs/{id}/` - Update existing item (song) - full update
- `PATCH /api/songs/{id}/` - Update existing item (song) - partial update
- `GET /api/songs/{id}/` - Get specific item (song)
- `DELETE /api/songs/{id}/` - Delete item (song)

### Business Rules Implementation
The unique constraint logic ensures:
- A song titled "Rock" can exist in Artist A (Primary) AND Artist B (Primary)
- A song titled "Rock" can exist in Album X (Secondary) AND Album Y (Secondary)
- "Rock" cannot exist twice in the same artist (Primary group violation)
- "Rock" cannot exist twice in the same album (Secondary group violation)
- The same title can appear across different artists and albums

**How This Satisfies the Requirements:**

The task requires: *"Each group should contain only unique item names. For example, an item named 'Rock' can appear in both the Primary and Secondary groups, but there can't be two items named 'Rock' in the same group."*

**Our Implementation:**
- **Primary Group (Artist)**: `unique_together = [('title', 'artist')]` ensures no duplicate song titles within the same artist
- **Secondary Group (Album)**: `unique_together = [('title', 'album')]` ensures no duplicate song titles within the same album
- **Combined Constraints**: `unique_together = [('title', 'artist'), ('title', 'album')]` enforces both constraints simultaneously

**Why This Works:**
1. **Artist as Primary Group**: Each artist is a unique "group" - you can't have two songs with the same title by the same artist
2. **Album as Secondary Group**: Each album is a unique "group" - you can't have two songs with the same title in the same album
3. **Cross-Group Duplicates Allowed**: The same song title can exist across different artists (different primary groups) and different albums (different secondary groups)

**Example Scenarios:**
‚úÖ **Allowed:**
- "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen (Artist: Queen, Album: A Night at the Opera)
- "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Panic! at the Disco (Artist: Panic! at the Disco, Album: Bohemian Rhapsody - Single)
- "Rock" by Artist A (Artist: Artist A, Album: Album X)
- "Rock" by Artist B (Artist: Artist B, Album: Album Y)

‚ùå **Blocked by Constraint:**
- Two songs titled "Rock" by the same Artist A (Primary group violation)
- Two songs titled "Rock" in the same Album X, even by different artists (Secondary group violation)

This implementation satisfies the requirement: "Each group should contain only unique item names. For example, an item named 'Rock' can appear in both the Primary and Secondary groups, but there can't be two items named 'Rock' in the same group."

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

#### macOS
```bash
# Install Python (if not already installed)
brew install python

# Install Redis
brew install redis

# Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
brew install postgresql
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
# Install Python (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

# Install Redis
sudo apt-get install redis-server

# Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
source venv/bin/activate && pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Start Redis server
# For macOS:
brew services start redis
# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo systemctl start redis

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env  # Create .env file from example
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The backend server must be running before starting the frontend!**

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install all dependencies from package.json
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env  # Create .env file from example
# Edit .env with your backend API URL and port

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Environment Configuration

### Backend (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with your database and Redis configuration:

```env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
PGDATABASE=your-database-name
PGUSER=your-database-user
PGPASSWORD=your-database-password
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1
```

### Frontend (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory with your backend API URL:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

**Note:** Customize the port in the API URL if your backend is running on a different port than 8000.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server first:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/`

2. **Start the frontend server:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

**Remember:** Both servers must be running simultaneously for the application to work properly.
